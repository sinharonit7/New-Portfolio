<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I'm Ranit Singha Roy, fresh out of college at IIT Kharagpur in India and now proudly working as a Software 
  Engineer at The eCEOs sdn bhd in Malaysia. Tech runs in my veins, and I'm particularly enthusiastic about 
  machine learning and deep learning. But, hey, life is more than just lines of code.</p>

<p>I'm a huge cricket fan. There's something about the strategy and the thrill of the game that gets me every time. 
  When I'm not glued to my computer screen, I'm often lost in the world of music. Whether it's relaxing with 
  some soul-soothing tunes or getting pumped up with something more upbeat, music is my constant companion.
   And then there's my love for adventure and challenges. 
   I'm always up for exploring new destinations, pushing my boundaries, and embracing the unknown.</p>

<p>From the tech scene to the cricket pitch, from music melodies to the thrill of adventure, I'm on a journey to
   make the most of every experience that comes my way. Life's a blend of technology, passion, and 
   the excitement of the unknown, and I'm here to savor it all.</p>
